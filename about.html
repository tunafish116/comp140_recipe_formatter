                    <h2>Why Comp140 Recipes are Flawed</h2>
                    <p>   
The common justification for recipes is that they force you think in terms of 
math and logic instead of a specific programming language. In theory this a great
idea, but in practice, the format of a "well written" recipe is so strict and
inconvenient to use that no student I have talked to has ever written their recipe
before their code. If recipes truly aim to help students think about their code,
they should be graded less strictly. Tedious formatting rules such as not allowing
equal-sign variable assignment and requiring subscript indexing should be removed.
I understand this opens up the possibility for students to write hand-wavy 
pseudocode that oversimplifies complex algorithms. However, this is preferable 
to what students already do, which is to code in python first anyways, then 
tailor a recipe based on their python code.
