<b>1.</b> Don't access nested elements directly. This because you can't do double subscripts in recipes.
Examples:
    instead of: 
        grid[1][2] = 3
    use:
        grid[1] = row
        row[2] = 3
    instead of:
        age[people[1]] = 2
    use:
        person = people[1]
        age[person] = 2

this also applies to nested dictionaries as well.




<b>2.</b> Methods that perform simple actions, such as getters, setters, and calculators
are often more concisely described in plain words.
For example, if this is your code:
    area = shape.area()
You should rewrite your recipe as:
    <i>area</i> ← the area of <i>shape</i>

There is an option in settings to automatically transform all methods calls with the format:
    object.method(...)
Into:
    the value returned by calling method(...) on the object <i>object</i>




<b>3.</b> Please still check each line for mistakes. If you put that much trust in a
 random person's code to do your assignment, I'm very flattered, thank you,
 but please don't. Some more exotic aspects of python have not been implemented
 into the recipe formatter yet.

 Examples of recognized python features:
    - Lists
    - Dictionaries
    - For and while loops
    - Range
    - Random
 Examples of unrecognized python features:
    - Classes
    - List comprehensions
    - Default dictionaries
    - Sets
    - Lambda functions
    - Many many more




<b>4.</b> Why can't it write my inputs and outputs WAAAAAHH

The point of this tool is to show how stupid certain aspects of recipes are.
The fact a couple lines of replaceAll using regex can get you to 80% of a full
recipe is proof that writing recipe steps is redundant work, and is basically
porting your python program to another language. Inputs and outputs, however,
actually require brainpower to write, and to automate that task would require
something like ChatGPT. This aspect of recipies can at least be justified in 
the name of learning. This is not a tool for avoiding learning.
Sorry you'll still have to write your inputs and outputs yourself :3




<b>5.</b> Other stuff that may be useful
    - To italicize "var_name", add "var_name=" somewhere in your code text
    - To recognize "var_name" as a dictionary, add "var_name={}" somewhere in your code text
    - To escape the stress of Comp140, click on the "about" button
